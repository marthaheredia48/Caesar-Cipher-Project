# Caesar Cipher Tool

**Caesar Cipher Tool** is a Python program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher. This cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

This project was developed during the **Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program 2023**.

## Features
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt or decrypt messages using a Caesar cipher with a customizable shift key.
- **Supports All Characters**: Handles uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.
- **Flexible Key Range**: Allows key values from 0 to 93, covering a broad range of possible shifts.

## How It Works
1. **Encrypt or Decrypt**: The program takes an input message and a shift key to either encrypt or decrypt the message.
2. **Character Wrapping**: Handles wrapping around the end of the character set to ensure all characters are processed correctly.
