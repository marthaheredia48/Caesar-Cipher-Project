# Caesar Cipher Project

This project implements the **Caesar Cipher**, a classic encryption technique used to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number. This project was developed during the **Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program 2023**.

## Features

- **Encryption & Decryption**: Encrypt or decrypt messages by shifting letters in the alphabet based on a user-defined key.
- **Customizable Key**: Users can choose a key (a number from 0 to 25) to define the shift.
- **Input Validation**: The program validates the user input to ensure proper functionality.
- **Case Insensitive**: All input characters are converted to uppercase for uniform processing, though non-alphabetical characters are left unchanged.

## How it Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting the letters of the message according to the key provided by the user. Each letter in the alphabet is replaced by the letter that is a fixed number of positions away from it (the key). The same key can be used for both encryption and decryption:
- **Encryption** shifts the letters forward by the key.
- **Decryption** shifts the letters backward by the key.
